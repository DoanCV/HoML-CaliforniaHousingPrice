# Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow (Chapter 2)
### Introduction
Chapter 2 of this book demonstrates the sturucture of a machine learning project with the popular California Housing Price dataset. This repository hosts my attempt on the exercises and the project.

Basic structure presented in the book:
1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
