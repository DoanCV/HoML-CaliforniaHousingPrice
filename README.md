# Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow (In Progress)
### Introduction
Chapter 2 of this book demonstrates the structure of a machine learning project with the popular California Housing Price dataset. The author states that some features were removed for teaching purposes and that the data is not recent. Given that Bay Area housing is very expensive and that the data is not recent, the conclusions from the model may not agree with popular belief. This repository hosts my attempt on the exercises and the project.


##### The basic structure presented in the book:
1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
